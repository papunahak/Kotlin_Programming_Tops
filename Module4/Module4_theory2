Q. Differences Between Fragment and Activity:

Activity                                                                       Fragment

->Represents a single screen in an application.                             ->A reusable UI component that is part of an Activity.

->Managed independently by the Android system.                              ->Depends on the host Activityâ€™s lifecycle.

->Not reusable across different Activities.                                 ->Can be reused in multiple Activities or within the same Activity.

->Occupies the entire screen by default.                                    ->Can take up only a part of the screen (ideal for multi-pane layouts).

Q.How does Android handle fragment lifecycle differently from activity lifecycle?

->Fragments depend on the host Activity, meaning when an Activity is destroyed, all its Fragments are also destroyed.
->A Fragment can be added/removed dynamically while the Activity is running.
->Fragments provide a more flexible and reusable UI design by supporting multiple panes within the same Activity.
